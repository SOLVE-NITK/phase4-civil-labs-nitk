Q 1. Why is the soil sample compacted to a bulk density similar to that of site from which the sample is obtained from? <br>
a. To match the moisture content<br>
<b>b. To give an accurate representation of the site soil as bulk density affects permeability</b><br>

c. None of the above<br>
d. All of the above<br>

Q 9. Why is the water used for the test de-aired?<br>
<b>a. In order to make sure the flow is as steady as possible </b><br>
b. So that external particles don’t interfere in the test<br>
c. Maintain consistent density of water<br>
d. To remove impurities<br>
