16. Plot graph of Axial load Vs Penetration for 300 rpm.<br>
<img src="images/R16.PNG"><br>

17. Observe the nature of graph and click on the NEXT button to proceed to the next step.<br>
<img src="images/R17.PNG"><br>

18. Repeat the same procedure for the speed of 400 rpm.<br>
<img src="images/R18.PNG"><br>

19. We will get graph for 400 rpm similar to 300 rpm and click on the NEXT button to proceed to the next step.<br>
